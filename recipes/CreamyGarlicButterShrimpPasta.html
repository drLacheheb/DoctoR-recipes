        <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream
        </li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>

        <li>freshly chopped fresh parsley for garnish to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add butter and let melt. Reduce heat to low and add
            garlic. Cook until garlic is browned and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add shrimp, Greek seasoning, and red
            pepper flakes. Cook until shrimp starts to turn pink, turning shrimp occasionally, 2 to 4 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in cream cheese cubes until broken up and incorporated with butter and garlic. Pour in cream and milk
            and stir until incorporated with the cream cheese. Mix in Parmigiana Reggiano cheese and stir until well
            combined. </li>
        <li>Pour in some of the reserved pasta water, 2 tablespoons at a time, until sauce has reached desired
            consistency. Add pasta to sauce in the skillet and toss to coat. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve
            immediately. </li>
    </ol>
